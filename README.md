# OOP Based Calculator Package

## Introduction

A package can include one or more relevant modules, and modules can include multiple objects such as classes, functions, and so on.
We may need to develop a package that performs a specific task for both personal and public use. As a result, I demonstrated a Python calculator package that performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and nth root.

## Technologies
Python classes with protected and private attributes.
Unit testings

## Installation

Run the following to install:

"pip install git+ github.com/rukayah/OOP-Based-Calculator-Package"

## Usage

import the Calculator library using "from calculator import Calculator"

#### Using the addition method, with a memory value of 0.

calculator = Calculator()

calculator.add (20)  == 20

Follow the pattern for other basic operations.

## Developing calculator

To install calculator along with tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following in your virtualenv:

'''bash
$ pip install -e .[dev]
'''
